# js.todo
Hi everyone I am clearing all my JS doubts and I forgot to upload my first project of JS which is simple todo list which I made 1 year ago from now .  In this project I made a empty todo array and have given a prompt in which user can enter "add" , "list " , "delete", "quit" if you type 'quit' the game will be ended.
